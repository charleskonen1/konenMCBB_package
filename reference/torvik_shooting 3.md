# Get Bart Torvik team shooting splits

Retrieves shot location efficiency data for every team from Bart Torvik
— how often teams shoot from the rim, mid-range, and three-point line,
and how efficiently they convert from each zone, on both offense and
defense.

## Usage

``` r
torvik_shooting(
  year = as.integer(format(Sys.Date(), "%Y")),
  conf = "All",
  timeout = 20
)
```

## Arguments

- year:

  Integer. Season year (e.g. \`2026\` for 2025-26). Must be \`\>=
  2008\`. Defaults to the current year.

- conf:

  Character. Optional conference filter (e.g. \`"ACC"\`, \`"B10"\`). Use
  \`"All"\` (default) for all teams.

- timeout:

  Numeric. Request timeout in seconds. Default \`20\`.

## Value

A tibble with one row per team, containing:

- team:

  Team name (Torvik convention).

- conf:

  Conference abbreviation.

- gp:

  Games played.

- o_rim_made, o_rim_att:

  Rim shot makes and attempts (offense).

- o_rim_pct:

  Offensive rim shooting percentage.

- o_rim_rate:

  Percentage of field goal attempts taken at the rim.

- o_mid_made, o_mid_att:

  Mid-range makes and attempts (offense).

- o_mid_pct:

  Offensive mid-range shooting percentage.

- o_mid_rate:

  Percentage of field goal attempts from mid-range.

- o_three_made, o_three_att:

  Three-point makes and attempts (offense).

- o_three_pct:

  Offensive three-point percentage.

- o_three_rate:

  Percentage of field goal attempts from three.

- o_dunk_made, o_dunk_att:

  Dunk makes and attempts (offense).

- o_dunk_pct:

  Offensive dunk percentage.

- d_rim_made, d_rim_att:

  Rim shot makes and attempts allowed.

- d_rim_pct:

  Defensive rim shooting percentage allowed.

- d_rim_rate:

  Percentage of opponent FGA at the rim.

- d_mid_made, d_mid_att:

  Mid-range makes and attempts allowed.

- d_mid_pct:

  Defensive mid-range percentage allowed.

- d_mid_rate:

  Percentage of opponent FGA from mid-range.

- d_three_made, d_three_att:

  Three-point makes and attempts allowed.

- d_three_pct:

  Defensive three-point percentage allowed.

- d_three_rate:

  Percentage of opponent FGA from three.

## Details

Shot location data is one of the most actionable layers of college
basketball analytics. Understanding \*where\* a team gets its shots (and
forces opponents to shoot) goes beyond the four factors. A team with a
high \`o_rim_rate\` and high \`o_rim_pct\` is generating high-quality
offense near the basket; a team with low \`d_three_rate\` is
successfully pushing opponents away from the arc.

"Rim" shots are typically defined as within 4 feet of the basket.
"Mid-range" covers everything between the rim zone and the three-point
line.

## Examples

``` r
if (FALSE) { # \dontrun{
  # All teams, current season
  shooting <- torvik_shooting()

  # Best rim-finishing teams
  shooting |>
    dplyr::arrange(dplyr::desc(o_rim_pct)) |>
    dplyr::select(team, conf, o_rim_pct, o_rim_rate, o_three_rate)

  # Best rim-protecting defenses
  shooting |>
    dplyr::arrange(d_rim_pct) |>
    dplyr::select(team, conf, d_rim_pct, d_rim_rate)

  # Teams that live at the rim (high rim rate) and shoot few mid-rangers
  shooting |>
    dplyr::filter(o_rim_rate > 0.40, o_mid_rate < 0.20) |>
    dplyr::select(team, conf, o_rim_rate, o_mid_rate, o_three_rate, o_rim_pct)

  # SEC teams
  torvik_shooting(conf = "SEC")
} # }
